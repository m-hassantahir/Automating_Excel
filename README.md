# Automating_Excel
Automated Excel Spreadsheet Price Reduction and Visualization
This project automates a price reduction workflow on an Excel spreadsheet with three columns: transaction_id, product_id, and price. It implements the following functionalities:
1. 10% Price Reduction: Applies a 10% discount to each product's price using a formula.
2. Data Manipulation:
      i. Imports the target Excel file into Jupyter Notebook and assigns it to a variable.
      ii. Iterates through each row and applies the price reduction formula.
      iii. Saves the updated prices in a new column.
4. Visualization: Generates a bar chart displaying the original and discounted prices, positioned at column E2.

Technical Stack:
1.	openpyxl: Handles Excel file manipulation and formula application.
2.	matplotlib: Creates the bar chart visualization.
3.	pandas (optional): Can be used for advanced data manipulation tasks (not explicitly mentioned in your provided detail).

Key Skills Demonstrated:
1.	Python scripting for automation.
2.	Excel data manipulation using openpyxl.
3.	Data visualization with matplotlib.
